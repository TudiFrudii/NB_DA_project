This repository contains the data and the analysis that I performed for the project of the course "Network Based Data Analysis" held by professor Mario Lauria for the QCB study path in University of Trento (a.y. 2022/2023).

In the file `NDBA_project.Rmd` you can find all analysis I performed on the dataset contained in `data/GSE84046_series_matrix.txt`, which is also directly available from GEOquery library. 
In file `Network_based_data_analysis_project.pdf` I recap all my efforts in a report (needed for course evaluation), while `NDBA_pesentation.pdf` contains a ppPowerPoint presentation used for my oral examination. 
In the folder `data/` you can find all data of the initial publication.
